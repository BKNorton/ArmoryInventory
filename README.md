# ArmoryInventory

Work in progress.
Recently had to rewrite the app due to complications with the original, which is the reason for the single commit. 

Check back soon for more details.

To run this project:
  - Clone this repository to your local machine.
  - Open the solution in Visual Studios
  - Start the project with debugging (Make sure to start it in Windows Machine)
  - Currently the app will allow you to view the seeded test data, add new items (does not curently persist data), edit items, and delete items.
